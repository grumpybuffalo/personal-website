  "snippet": "Pictionary is a classic game in which players try to guess what other players are drawing. Quintessentially, Pictionary is played by two teams of two players (one teammate draws while the other teammate guesses.) Hasbro's official Pictionary rules also describe a \"three-player\" version of the game. In Hasbro's \"three-player\" game, one player is designated as the artist for the entire game; the other two players compete to win by guessing. Hasbro's game has some merits, but the poor artist can hardly be considered a \"player\" in the game. Hasbro's game is more like a two-player guessing game. In this blog post, we describe a Pictionary variant with no teams in which every player has a shot at winning. Our game is designed for three players, but it also works with more than three players."
