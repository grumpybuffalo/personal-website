These are the sort of features that biologists look for to establish life, not a heartbeat. It’s debatable whether viruses are alive, but it seems pretty clear that a zygote is already biologically alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may be helpful to emphasize that at this stage of the conversation, we aren’t yet saying anything philosophical about how valuable a zygote is or how we ought to treat zygotes. We’re just saying that biologically speaking, a zygote is a living organism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/flatworms-dont-have-hearts/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_biology #WMPLL_lifebegins</description></item><item><title>Abortion Is Never Safe</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/abortion-is-never-safe/</link><guid>8db7efea-0130-4de1-8996-12ba5dd093f4</guid><pubDate>2019-03-24</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/abortion-is-never-safe/abortion-is-never-safe-0-940.png"&gt;It’s extremely important to show compassion when dealing with this sensitive topic. Your top priority should be making it clear that you care about women, not just about fetuses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/abortion-is-never-safe/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_politics #WMPLL_womenshealth #WMPLL_society</description></item><item><title>Incest</title><link>https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/incest/</link><guid>a45cc2d8-4e7c-471f-8747-5f1e5249102c</guid><pubDate>2019-03-24</pubDate><description>&lt;img src="https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/incest/incest-0-940.png"&gt;Different people have different reasons for thinking abortion is justified in cases of pregnancy resulting from incestuous relationships. Some people focus on the status of the mother as a victim of a crime; this is similar to the proposal that abortion should be allowed in cases of rape. In reality, the child is another victim of the crime, and he or she should not be blamed or punished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other people focus on possible birth defects of the child; this is similar to the proposal that abortion should be allowed if the preborn child is diagnosed with a disability. In reality, we should support and care for people with disabilities, not kill them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See this post on our website: https://whatsmyprolifeline.com/posts/incest/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WMPLL_ethics</description></item></channel>
