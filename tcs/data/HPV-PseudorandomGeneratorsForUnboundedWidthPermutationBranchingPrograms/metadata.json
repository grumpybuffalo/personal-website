The corollary should be modified to assume \\(\\ell \\delta < 1\\), and the bound in the conclusion should be \\(\\varepsilon = \\ell \\delta / (1 - \\ell \\delta)\\). Correspondingly, Theorem 3.8 should assume \\(\\varepsilon \\leq 0.1 / \\ell\\) instead of merely \\(\\varepsilon \\leq 0.12\\). The main results of the paper are unaffected."
