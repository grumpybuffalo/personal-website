  Bell's theorem says, roughly, that it follows from the laws of quantum mechanics that two parties can interact instantaneously across arbitrary distances. This phenomenon, called "quantum nonlocality", has been called "the most profound discovery of science". The nature of these "interactions" is notoriously subtle. For example, the no-communication theorem says that quantum nonlocality is not useful for sending genuine signals. In this paper, we rule out one possible approach to characterizing the exact extent of the "nonlocal powers" granted by the laws of quantum mechanics. In particular, aside from quantum nonlocality, another situation in which two parties can interact in a limited way is if there is some discrete, classical device that each party is able to interact with. We prove that quantum nonlocality is not quite equivalent to any such discrete, classical device.
