      <b>About me:</b>
      I'm a third-year grad student at UT Austin studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science">theoretical
      computer science</a>. I have the good fortune to be advised by <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~diz/">David Zuckerman</a>. Previously, I was an undergrad at Caltech, where I was lucky to receive valuable mentorship from <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~schulman/">Leonard Schulman</a> and <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~umans/">Chris Umans</a>.
      <br /><br />
      I study computational complexity theory, which means I'm interested in the strengths of different computational resources. To what extent does randomness provide a computational advantage? How about quantum mechanics? Does parallelism always give a huge speedup? Is space more useful than time? Is it ever easier to check your work than it is to solve a problem from scratch? All of these questions can be made mathematically precise, and nobody knows the answers.
      <br /><br />
      My personal favorite open question is the "<b>L</b> vs. <b>BPL</b>" question: Is randomness ever necessary to solve a problem using only a little memory? To work on resolving this question, people like me study "pseudorandomness", which is any phenomenon where something looks more random than it actually is.

          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>: A "pseudorandom generator" is an algorithm that makes a few coin tosses and outputs a long sequence of bits (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, ...) that "look random" in some sense. In this paper, we present a pseudorandom generator whose output looks random in the following sense. Consider a statement that says something like
          <div style="margin:20px;">((x<sub>3</sub> = 0 AND x<sub>7</sub> = 1 AND x<sub>2</sub> = 1) OR (x<sub>6</sub> = 1 AND (x<sub>5</sub> = 0 OR x<sub>1</sub> = 0) AND ...)).</div>
          Each variable is only allowed to appear one time, and the parentheses are only allowed to be nested to a depth of, say, 100. For every statement of that form, the probability that the statement evaluates to true when you plug in the output of our pseudorandom generator is roughly the same as the probability that the statement evaluates to true when you plug in truly random bits. Our pseudorandom generator is "near-optimal", i.e., our algorithm makes very few coin tosses.

          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>: A "randomized" algorithm tosses 
          coins to make decisions, whereas a "deterministic" 
          algorithm doesn't use any randomness. Most theoretical 
          computer scientists believe that if a problem can be 
          solved by a randomized algorithm, then it can also be 
          solved by a deterministic algorithm that uses about the

          also be solved by a deterministic algorithm that uses 
          about the same amount of memory, with the caveat that

          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
            Quantum algorithms are algorithms that exploit quantum 
            effects, requiring special hardware that, broadly 
            speaking, nobody has managed to build yet. In this 
            paper, we study quantum algorithms for two types of 
            problems. In the first type of problem, Alice has some 
            data x, Bob has some data y, and the two of them would 
            like to figure out whether the pair (x, y) has some 
            property P using as little communication as possible. 
            For example, maybe x and y are numbers between 1 and a 
            million, and P is the property that x &gt; y. The second 
            type of problem is similar to the game 20 Questions. 
            Alice chooses x. If Bob specifies y, then Alice tells 
            him whether (x, y) has property P. Bob's goal is to 
            learn x by making as few queries as possible. We prove 
            that if the same property P is used to formulate each 
            problem, then the two problems can't both have extremely 
            efficient quantum algorithms.

        <div class="details">
          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
          Bell's theorem says, roughly, that it follows from the laws
          of quantum mechanics that two parties can interact
          instantaneously across arbitrary distances. This phenomenon,
          called "quantum nonlocality", has been called "the most
          profound discovery of science". The nature of these
          "interactions" is notoriously subtle. For example, the
          no-communication theorem says that quantum nonlocality is
          not useful for sending genuine signals. In this paper, we
          rule out one possible approach to characterizing the exact
          extent of the "nonlocal powers" granted by the laws of
          quantum mechanics. In particular, aside from quantum
          nonlocality, another situation in which two parties can
          interact in a limited way is if there is some discrete,
          classical device that each party is able to interact with.
          We prove that quantum nonlocality is not quite equivalent to
          any such discrete, classical device.

          times. Suppose the estimation algorithm makes <i>n</i>

          <u style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold">Erratum</u> (May 2017): In Lemma 2, the 
          space complexity should be O(s + log w + log(1/&delta;) 
          + log(1/&gamma;)). That is, there is a missing O(log(1/&delta;))
          term in the lemma statement. This does not

          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
          There's a well-known conjecture in complexity theory
          ("L = BPL") that says that randomness isn't necessary for
          solving problems using a small amount of computer memory.
          The most promising approach to proving this conjecture is to
          design a suitable kind of "pseudorandom generator". But in
          principle, one could hope to prove L = BPL using a totally
          different approach. In this paper, we prove a theorem that
          can be roughly stated as follows. If every true statement
          along the lines of L = BPL can be proven using the
          pseudorandom generator approach, then in fact L = BPL
          (actually the conclusion is slightly weaker).

          <u>Description:</u> This is an essay I wrote as an undergrad
          for a class on free will taught by
          <a href="http://www.hss.caltech.edu/content/christopher-r-hitchcock">Christopher Hitchcock</a>.
          In the essay, I respond to a specific objection to <i>compatibilism</i>,
          the thesis that free will is possible even in a deterministic
          universe.<br /><br />
          <u>Notes:</u> This essay won the Gordon McClure Memorial
          Communication Prize in Philosophy from Caltech's HSS division.
