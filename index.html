      <b>About me:</b>
      I'm a second-year grad student at UT Austin studying theoretical
      computer science. I have the good fortune to be advised by <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~diz/">David Zuckerman</a>. I'm interested in the strengths of different computational resources. To what extent is randomness useful for computation? How about quantum mechanics? Does parallelism always give a huge computational advantage? Is space more useful than time? Is it ever easier to check your work than it is to solve a problem from scratch? All of these questions can be made mathematically precise, and nobody knows the answers. My personal favorite open problem is the "L vs. BPL" problem: Is randomness ever helpful for solving a problem using as little memory as possible?

          coins to make decisions, whereas a "deterministic"

          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
            Quantum algorithms are algorithms that exploit quantum 
            effects, requiring special hardware that, broadly 
            speaking, nobody has managed to build yet. In this 
            paper, we study quantum algorithms for two types of 
            problems. In the first type of problem, Alice has some 
            data x, Bob has some data y, and the two of them would 
            like to figure out whether the pair (x, y) has some 
            property P using as little communication as possible. 
            For example, maybe x and y are numbers between 1 and a 
            million, and P is the property that x &gt; y. The second 
            type of problem is similar to the game 20 Questions. 
            Alice chooses x. If Bob specifies y, then Alice tells 
            him whether (x, y) has property P. Bob's goal is to 
            learn x by making as few queries as possible. We prove 
            that if the same property P is used to formulate each 
            problem, then the two problems can't both have extremely 
            efficient quantum algorithms.

        <summary>With Cole A. Graham. In PRL, 2017.</summary>
        <div class="details">
          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
          Bell's theorem says, roughly, that it follows from the laws
          of quantum mechanics that two parties can interact
          instantaneously across arbitrary distances. This phenomenon,
          called "quantum nonlocality", has been called "the most
          profound discovery of science". The nature of these
          "interactions" is notoriously subtle. For example, the
          no-communication theorem says that quantum nonlocality is
          not useful for sending genuine signals. In this paper, we
          rule out one possible approach to characterizing the exact
          extent of the "nonlocal powers" granted by the laws of
          quantum mechanics. In particular, aside from quantum
          nonlocality, another situation in which two parties can
          interact in a limited way is if there is some discrete,
          classical device that each party is able to interact with.
          We prove that quantum nonlocality is not quite equivalent to
          any such discrete, classical device.

          Suppose you have a randomized algorithm that estimates

          times. Suppose the estimation algorithm makes <i>n</i> 
          coin tosses. This situation seems to call for <i>nk</i> 
          coin tosses in total. In this paper, we show that you

          coin tosses if you use some tricks.

          <u style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold">Erratum</u> (May 2017): In Lemma 2, the 
          space complexity should be O(s + log w + log(1/&delta;) 
          + log(1/&gamma;)). That is, there is a missing O(log(1/&delta;))
          term in the lemma statement. This does not 
          affect anything else in the paper. <br /><br />
          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
          There's a well-known conjecture in complexity theory
          ("L = BPL") that says that randomness isn't useful for
          solving problems using a small amount of computer memory.
          The most promising approach to proving this conjecture is to
          design a suitable kind of "pseudorandom generator". But in
          principle, one could hope to prove L = BPL using a totally
          different approach. In this paper, we prove a theorem that
          can be roughly stated as follows. If every true statement
          along the lines of L = BPL can be proven using the
          pseudorandom generator approach, then in fact L = BPL
          (actually the conclusion is slightly weaker).

          Imagine that many people (or computers) are connected by a

          conversation, but unfortunately, an adversary is altering
          their messages to confuse them. The parties may deal with
          this noise by encoding their conversation in whatever way

      Just in case you read my philosophical opinions and you're
      still looking for something to disagree with me about :)

          I support a ban on abortion. I think we should use nonviolent
          methods to support pregnant women. I support government-funded pregnancy centers and legally mandated paid maternity leave.

          I support repealing the second amendment. In the meantime,
          I support strict gun control laws that do not violate the
          second amendment.

          I support a ban on physician-assisted suicide and all forms of
          euthanasia.

          intentionally destroying human embryos.

          I oppose civil same-sex "marriage" constructs. I recognize
          that having homosexual inclinations does not mean that you've
          done anything wrong. I support legislation that protects the
          LGBT community from unjust discrimination and harrassment. I
          try to be a good ally.

          I oppose torture. More generally, I oppose almost all violent
          actions performed by the U.S. military. I am grateful for the
          service of those members of the military who honorably and
          ethically defend the country.

          I support making it sufficiently easy to legally immigrate
          to the U.S. that there is essentially no temptation to
          immigrate here illegally. I want the border between the U.S.
          and Mexico to be similar to the border between Texas and New
          Mexico.
