      <b>About me:</b>
      I'm a grad student at UT Austin studying theoretical
      computer science. I'm interested in the power of different
      computational resources. Is randomness useful for computation? How
      about quantum mechanics? Does parallelism always give a huge
      computational advantage? Is space more useful than time? Is it
      ever easier to check your work than it is to solve a problem from
      scratch? All of these questions can be made mathematically
      precise, and nobody knows the answers. My personal favorite open
      problem is the "L vs. BPL" problem: Is randomness ever helpful for
      reducing the amount of memory used to solve a problem?

            coins to make decisions, whereas a "deterministic" 
            algorithm doesn't use any randomness. Most theoretical 
            computer scientists believe that if a problem can be 
            solved by a randomized algorithm, then it can also be 
            solved by a deterministic algorithm that uses about the 
            same amount of time and memory. But nobody knows how to 
            prove it. We prove that if a problem can be solved by a 
            fast randomized algorithm, then it can also be solved by 
            a deterministic algorithm that uses about the same 
            amount of memory, with the caveat that the deterministic 
            algorithm might give the wrong answer on a tiny fraction

            <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
            Quantum algorithms are algorithms that exploit quantum 
            effects, requiring special hardware that, broadly 
            speaking, nobody has managed to build yet. In this 
            paper, we study quantum algorithms for two types of 
            problems. In the first type of problem, Alice has some 
            data x, Bob has some data y, and the two of them would 
            like to figure out whether the pair (x, y) has some 
            property P using as little communication as possible. 
            For example, maybe x and y are numbers between 1 and a 
            million, and P is the property that x &gt; y. The second 
            type of problem is similar to the game 20 Questions. 
            Alice chooses x. If Bob specifies y, then Alice tells 
            him whether (x, y) has property P. Bob's goal is to 
            learn x by making as few queries as possible. We prove 
            that if the same property P is used to formulate each 
            problem, then the two problems can't both have extremely 
            efficient quantum algorithms.

            <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
            Bell's theorem says, roughly, that it follows from the laws
            of quantum mechanics that two parties can interact
            instantaneously across arbitrary distances. This phenomenon,
            called "quantum nonlocality", has been called "the most
            profound discovery of science". The nature of these
            "interactions" is notoriously subtle. For example, the
            no-communication theorem says that quantum nonlocality is
            not useful for sending genuine signals. In this paper, we
            rule out one possible approach to characterizing the exact
            extent of the "nonlocal powers" granted by the laws of
            quantum mechanics. In particular, aside from quantum
            nonlocality, another situation in which two parties can
            interact in a limited way is if there is some discrete,
            classical device that each party is able to interact with.
            We prove that quantum nonlocality is not quite equivalent to
            any such discrete, classical device.

            <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
            There's a well-known conjecture in complexity theory
            ("L = BPL") that says that randomness isn't useful for
            solving problems using a small amount of computer memory.
            The most promising approach to proving this conjecture is to
            design a suitable kind of "pseudorandom generator". But in
            principle, one could hope to prove L = BPL using a totally
            different approach. In this paper, we prove a theorem that
            can be roughly stated as follows. If every true statement
            along the lines of L = BPL can be proven using the
            pseudorandom generator approach, then in fact L = BPL
            (actually the conclusion is slightly weaker).

        As for wisdom, where does she come from?<br />
        Where is the place of understanding?<br />
        She is hidden from the eyes of every living thing;<br />
        even from the birds of the air she is concealed.
