      <b>About me:</b>
      I'm a fourth-year grad student at UT Austin studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science">theoretical
      computer science</a>. I have the good fortune to be advised by <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~diz/">David Zuckerman</a>. Previously, I was an undergrad at Caltech, where I was lucky to receive valuable mentorship from <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~schulman/">Leonard Schulman</a> and <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~umans/">Chris Umans</a>.
      <br /><br />
      I study computational complexity theory, which means I'm interested in the strengths of different computational resources. To what extent does randomness provide a computational advantage? How about quantum mechanics? Does parallelism always give a huge speedup? Is space more useful than time? Is it ever easier to check your work than it is to solve a problem from scratch? All of these questions can be made mathematically precise, and nobody knows the answers.
      <br /><br />
      My personal favorite open question is the "<b>L</b> vs. <b>BPL</b>" question: Is randomness ever necessary to solve a problem using only a little memory? To work on resolving this question, people like me study "pseudorandomness", which is any phenomenon where something looks more random than it actually is.

          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>: A "decision problem" is a problem where the answer is always "yes" or "no," e.g., the problem of determining whether a given number is prime. Suppose there's a randomized algorithm A that solves some decision problem with high probability using a small amount of memory. Does that automatically mean there's a deterministic algorithm that solves the same problem using a similar amount of memory? In other words, is it always possible to "derandomize" any low-memory decision algorithm? Computer scientists think so, but we're not sure how to prove it. If A has the special feature that it never gives false positives, derandomization is potentially easier. Some of the most promising approaches treat A as a "black box," meaning that the deterministic algorithm would just simulate A in a few carefully crafted scenarios and then figure out the correct answer based on what A outputs in those scenarios. In this paper, we prove that if it is possible to derandomize all low-memory decision algorithms that never give false positives in a black-box manner, then it is possible to derandomize all low-memory decision algorithms, whether they give false positives or not.

          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>: A "pseudorandom generator" is an algorithm that makes a few coin tosses and outputs a long sequence of bits (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, ...) that "look random" in some sense. In this paper, we present a pseudorandom generator whose output looks random in the following sense. Consider a polynomial such as
          <div style="margin:20px;">
            y = x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>3</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>x<sub>7</sub>x<sub>8</sub> + x<sub>4</sub>x<sub>5</sub> + ...
          </div>
          Each variable is only allowed to appear one time (it's "read-once"). The arithmetic is mod 2 (+ is really XOR, and y is either 0 or 1). For every polynomial y of that form, the expected value of y when you plug in the output of our pseudorandom generator is approximately the same (say, to within plus or minus 0.01) as it is when you plug in truly random bits. For a fixed error value like 0.01, our pseudorandom generator is *optimal*, i.e., it makes essentially the smallest possible number of coin tosses.

        <div class="details">
          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
            Quantum algorithms are algorithms that exploit quantum 
            effects, requiring special hardware that, broadly 
            speaking, nobody has managed to build yet. In this 
            paper, we study quantum algorithms for two types of 
            problems. In the first type of problem, Alice has some 
            data x, Bob has some data y, and the two of them would 
            like to figure out whether the pair (x, y) has some 
            property P using as little communication as possible. 
            For example, maybe x and y are numbers between 1 and a 
            million, and P is the property that x &gt; y. The second 
            type of problem is similar to the game 20 Questions. 
            Alice chooses x. If Bob specifies y, then Alice tells 
            him whether (x, y) has property P. Bob's goal is to 
            learn x by making as few queries as possible. We prove 
            that if the same property P is used to formulate each 
            problem, then the two problems can't both have extremely 
            efficient quantum algorithms.

          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
          Bell's theorem says, roughly, that it follows from the laws
          of quantum mechanics that two parties can interact
          instantaneously across arbitrary distances. This phenomenon,
          called "quantum nonlocality", has been called "the most
          profound discovery of science". The nature of these
          "interactions" is notoriously subtle. For example, the
          no-communication theorem says that quantum nonlocality is
          not useful for sending genuine signals. In this paper, we
          rule out one possible approach to characterizing the exact
          extent of the "nonlocal powers" granted by the laws of
          quantum mechanics. In particular, aside from quantum
          nonlocality, another situation in which two parties can
          interact in a limited way is if there is some discrete,
          classical device that each party is able to interact with.
          We prove that quantum nonlocality is not quite equivalent to
          any such discrete, classical device.

          ("L = BPL") that says that randomness isn't necessary for
          solving problems using a small amount of computer memory.
          The most promising approach to proving this conjecture is to
          design a suitable kind of "pseudorandom generator". But in
          principle, one could hope to prove L = BPL using a totally

          can be roughly stated as follows. If every true statement
          along the lines of L = BPL can be proven using the
          pseudorandom generator approach, then in fact L = BPL
          (actually the conclusion is slightly weaker).

      <details>
        <summary>With Leonard J. Schulman. In SODA 2016.</summary>
        <div class="details">
          <u>Not-so-abstract</u>:
          Imagine that many people (or computers) are connected by a
          network of communication channels. They would like to have a
          conversation, but unfortunately, an adversary is altering
          their messages to confuse them. The parties may deal with
          this noise by encoding their conversation in whatever way
          they like. In this paper, we determine the maximum amount of
          noise that can be tolerated in a couple different models as
          a function of the particular communication network.

            I favor making it very easy to legally immigrate to the U.S.
            I want the border between the U.S. and Mexico to be similar to
            the border between Texas and New Mexico. I don't think any
