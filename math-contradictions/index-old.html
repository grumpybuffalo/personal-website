      <h1>Top 10 Blatant Contradictions in Math</h1>
      
      <p>
        Sorry, matheists, but every thinking person admits that
        abstract objects don't exist. Math is just a fairy tale invented
        by professors to control their grad students. Pathetically, the
        fairy tale isn't even internally consistent:

        1. A theorem by Shamir says that IP = PSPACE, but a theorem
        by Chang et al. says that there exists an oracle A such that
        IP<sup>A</sup> &ne; PSPACE<sup>A</sup>.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        Every middle school student knows that if you do the same thing
        to both sides of an equation, it stays an equation! So much for
        matheists' doctrine of "theorem inerrancy".
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        2. Bell's theorem says that through quantum entanglement,
        objects can instantaneously affect each other across arbitrary
        distances. But the no-communication theorem says the opposite:
        acting on a quantum system has no effect on any entangled
        systems.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        What's more, the no-communication theorem is just plagiarized
        from physicists! One of the laws of special relativity says you
        can't send a signal faster than the speed of light. Sound
        familiar?
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        3. Supposedly, 0.999... = 1.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        If matheists learned how to use logic, they would immediately
        see how silly this is.
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        4. Taylor's theorem says that every infinitely differentiable
        function can be expanded as a Taylor series, but the Taylor
        series of exp(-1/x<sup>2</sup>) around zero is identically zero.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        Matheists only buy this stuff because of scare tactics.
        They're told that if they don't believe the theorems, they will
        not receive eternal employment.
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        5. A theorem by Johnson says that it takes e<sup>&Omega;(d)</sup> books
        to build a stack that leans over distance d. But a theorem by
        Paterson and Zwick says O(d<sup>3</sup>) books suffice.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        Don't those dumb matheists realize that polynomials grow slower
        than exponentials?
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        6. The law of large numbers says that if you keep sampling a
        probability distribution, the sample average converges to the
        expectation. But a theorem by Poisson says that if you sample
        from the standard Cauchy distribution, the sample average still
        follows the standard Cauchy distribution.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        More like the rule of thumb of large numbers, am I right?
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        7. Cayley's theorem says that every finite group is a subgroup
        of S<sub>n</sub> for some n. That means there are only countably
        many finite groups. But there are uncountably many distinct
        regular polygons (since there are uncountably many side lengths
        by a theorem of Cantor), and each has a
        finite group of symmetries.

      <p><i>
        Connect the dots, sheeple. It's not that hard.
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        8. G&ouml;del's completeness theorem says that the standard
        axioms of logic are enough for any proof; no axioms are missing.
        But G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem says that there does not
        exist a complete list of axioms; there are always missing axioms.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        The contradiction is right there in the names of the theorems!
        Maybe matheists would see it if they weren't so brainwashed by
        the sermons they're always listening to in classrooms.
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        9. A standard theorem of Euclidean geometry says that if two solids are
        congruent, then they have the same volume. But the Banach-Tarski
        paradox says that you can cut a unit ball into five pieces and
        rearrange them into two disjoint unit balls.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        Let me guess: this theorem was "taken out of context"?
      </i></p>
      
      <b>
        10. Kolmogorov's zero-one law implies that either 100% of numbers have
        terminating decimal expansions or else 0% of numbers have
        terminating decimal expansions. But some numbers (like 1/2) do
        and others (like 1/3) don't.
      </b>
      
      <p><i>
        Remember, just because some old guys published some proofs, that
        doesn't make a theorem absolute truth.

      to poke fun at lists of "contradictions" in the bible. The
      theorems listed on this page are real theorems. The apparent
      contradictions can be resolved. References below.]
