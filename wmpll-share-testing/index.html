    <meta property="og:description" content="When possible, doctors should ensure that the mother and fetus both thrive. In extreme circumstances, doctors should provide lifesaving treatment to the mother even when they know that the fetus will unfortunately die as a result. However, doctors should never intentionally kill the fetus -- not even for a noble goal like saving the mother's life." />
