The page displays a visualization of the Mandelbrot set. For information
about the Mandelbrot set, check out Wikipedia's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">article</a> on the
subject.
<br>
<br>
Every frame, for each pixel, the program calculates one more item in the
Mandelbrot sequence that corresponds to the complex number that
corresponds to that pixel. If a pixel "escapes" (if the sequence exceeds
2), it is drawn in red. Lighter red indicates that it took more
iterations to escape.
<br>
<br>
Each number at the bottom is the number of iterations that have been
calcualated for a particular chunk of the pixels. The visualization is
broken into seven chunks that are all analyzed in parallel.
