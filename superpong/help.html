    This two-player game is just like classic pong, with one important difference: <b>you can shoot.</b><br><br>
    Each paddle is equipped with a powerful missile launcher capable of firing once per second.
    Collect ammunition by hitting the ball with your paddle or shooting the ball.<br><br>
    If you shoot the ball, it will split into two, unless it is too small in which case it will disappear.<br><br>
    If you shoot the other player's paddle, the paddle will break where you shot it.
    Shooting the other player's gun will render it unusable for ten seconds.<br><br>

    The keys for the left paddle are as follows:<br>
    <div style="margin-left:30px;">
      Up: W<br>
      Down: S<br>
      Fire: D
    </div>

    <br>

    For the right paddle:<br>
    <div style="margin-left:30px;">
      Up: I<br>
      Down: K<br>
      Fire: J
    </div>

    <br>

    Begin by pressing Play, or by pressing the "g" key.
    <br><br>

    The big numbers in the middle of the screen are the current scores.
    The small numbers in the middle are the number of bullets each player has.<br><br>

    Games are played two 11 points, win by two. After the game is complete, a new one will begin.
    The numbers at the top of the screen keep track of how many wins each player has recieved.<br><br>

    The game never says someone wins the match, but it is reccommended to play to three games.
    Make sure you both agree on what you are playing to <i>before</i> beginning the game.<br><br>

    If you want, you can give a player a handicap. To change the size of the left paddle, use the following keys:
    <div style="margin-left:30px;">
      Smaller: 1<br>
      Bigger: 2<br>
      Reset: 3
    </div>

    <br>

    For the right paddle:<br>
    <div style="margin-left:30px;">
      Smaller: 8<br>
      Bigger: 9<br>
      Reset: 0
    </div>
