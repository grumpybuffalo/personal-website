        Pictionary is a classic game in which players try to guess what
        other players are drawing. Quintessentially, Pictionary
        is played by two teams of two players (one teammate draws while
        the other teammate guesses.)
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/pictionary.pdf">Hasbro's
        official Pictionary rules</a> also describe a "three-player" version
        of the game. In Hasbro's "three-player" game, one player is designated
        as the artist for the entire game; the other two players compete
        to win by guessing. Hasbro's game has some merits, but the
        poor artist can hardly be considered a "player" in the game. Hasbro's game is
        more like a <i>two</i>-player guessing game.
        <br /><br />
        In this document, we describe an alternative
        three-player Pictionary variant in which the three players have
        symmetric roles.

          How to play our game
        </div>
        Necessary materials:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A source of words (e.g. the cards for the original Pictionary game).
          </li>
          <li>
            A drawing surface that everyone can see (e.g. a whiteboard).
          </li>
          <li>
            A one-minute timer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Gameplay:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In each round, one player is the artist and the other two
            players are guessers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The word source generates a word that the artist must draw.
            The artist spends up to one minute drawing it. (The standard Pictionary rules 
            apply: no alphabet symbols, no gestures, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            If a guesser correctly identifies the word, the round is over.
            The successful guesser and the artist each get one point.
          </li>
          <li>
            If neither guesser identifies the word within one minute, the
            round is over and nobody gets any points.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the rare event that the two guessers correctly guess the word
            at the same time, the round is over. The artist gets one point.
            Neither guesser gets a point.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players cycle through being the artist <b>with one
            exception</b>: if it would be your turn to draw, but your score
            is <b>strictly</b> greater than each of the other two players'
            scores, then you are "ineligible to draw" and your turn is
            skipped.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Winning:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you have at least 9 points and you have <b>strictly</b> 
            more points than each other player at the beginning of a 
            round, then you are "eligible to win" during that round.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you get a point in a round in which you are eligible to
            win, then the game is over and <b>you win!</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: At the beginning of a round, A has 7 points, B has 
            8 points, and C has 9 points. B draws and C successfully 
            guesses the word. The game over. The final scores are (7, 
            9, 10) and C wins. This example demonstrates that the win 
            condition is <b>not</b> simply "game to 10, win by two."
          </li>
        </ul>

          Discussion
        </div>
        The reader may wonder why our rules are so complicated. Let us
        consider some simpler rules. What if we simply stipulated that
        players cycle through being the artist, the artist and guesser
        each get one point when the word is successfully identified, and
        the first player to 10 points wins the game?
        <br /><br />
        These simple rules have the defect of <b>ties</b>. Suppose the 
        scores are (8, 9, 9). B draws and C successfully guesses the 
        word. Then B and C reach 10 points at the same time. It doesn't 
        seem fair to declare either one of them the winner, since 
        they had no control over who draws and who guesses.
        <br /><br />
        A straightforward attempt to address this defect is to 
        stipulate that the game continues until some player has at 
        least 10 points and has strictly more points than each other 
        player. These simple rules still have the defect that in some 
        situations, a player <b>knows that he or she will not win</b> 
        even though the game isn't over. Suppose again that the scores 
        are (8, 9, 9). It's impossible for A to win, because if A ever 
        gets a point, then so does either B or C.
        
        <br /><br />
        A natural attempt to fix this second defect is to stipulate that
        the game continues until some player has at least 10 points and
        is ahead by a margin of at least two points ("game to 10, win by
        two"). These rules still have some serious defects:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In some situations, <b>one guesser doesn't want to 
            guess.</b> Suppose the scores are (7, 9, 8) and B is the 
            artist. If A successfully guesses the word, the game will
            end and B will win, whereas if C successfully guesses the
            word, the game will continue. So A would rather wait until
            C is the artist to guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even worse, in some situations, <b>neither guesser wants to 
            guess!</b> Suppose the scores are (5, 6, 9) and C is 
            drawing. If A or B correctly guesses the word, they'll 
            immediately lose! They'd rather wait until one of them is 
            the artist.
          </li>
          <li>
            In some situations, <b>the artist doesn't want to draw.</b>
            Suppose the scores are (7, 8, 9) and A is the artist. If A
            draws, there's a risk that C might correctly guess the word
            and win the game. On the other hand, A can just wait for B's
            turn as artist. When B draws, even if C successfully guesses
            the word, the scores will be (7, 9, 10) and the game will
            continue.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Our rules avoid all these defects:
        <ul>
          <li>
            With our rules, <b>there can never be a tie.</b> After all, in
            each round, at most one player is eligible to win.
          </li>
          <li>
            With our rules, <b>if the game isn't over, any player might 
            win.</b> Indeed, no matter what's happened so far, you'll 
            win if from now on, whenever you're a guesser, you 
            successfully guess the word, and whenever you're the 
            artist, the guesser with fewer points successfully guesses 
            the word.
          </li>
          <li>
            With our rules, <b>it's always reasonable for both guessers 
            to guess</b>. After all, if another player is eligible to
            win, guessing will <i>prevent</i> that player from winning.
          </li>
          <li>
            With our rules, <b>it's always reasonable for the artist to
            draw</b>. After all, if another player is eligible to win,
            that player will still be eligible to win next round if you
            refrain from drawing, and you have to get points somehow.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Admittedly, there are still some contrived scenarios in which 
        someone might choose to not guess or choose to not draw. For 
        example, the two guessers might feel that the artist is 
        actually much better than they are and is only eligible to draw 
        due to bad luck, so they might refrain from guessing. For 
        another example, suppose A is the artist and B is eligible to 
        win. A might feel that B is particularly good at guessing A's 
        drawings and A is particularly good at guessing C's drawings. A 
        might therefore choose to not draw. In practice, we haven't 
        encountered these issues.
